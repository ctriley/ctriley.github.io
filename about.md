Connor Rileyâ€™s general interests reside at the intersection of artificial intelligence and optimization. Particularly, he is interested in applying artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning to enhance existing optimization algorithms. His current research focuses on large scale vehicle routing problems for on-demand multimodal transportation to demonstrate more attractive alternatives to existing public transportation solutions. Connor hopes to enter academia after graduation.
